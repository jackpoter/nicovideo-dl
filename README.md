nicovideo-dl
============

nicovideo-dl lets you download videos from niconico. The original script stopped working for me, so I decided to fork it.
I haven't tested all the features, so it's possible some of them don't work. Feel free to open an issue if you find something broken.

Changes from the original nicovideo-dl
--------------------------------------

 - Fixed the "unknown SSL protocol version" bug
 - Converted to Python 3
 - Made some errors more verbose

Todo
----

 - Replace the "possible error causes" text with actual accurate error message
